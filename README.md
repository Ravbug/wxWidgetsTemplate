wxWidgets is an efficient cross-platform GUI library for C++. However, wxWidgets can be quite difficult to set up on all of the supported systems, especially for new users.

This template project addresses the high barrier of entry. 

## Notable features you get with this template
- Easily compile versions of your app for Windows, macOS, and Linux, using a single codebase with the preconfigured Xcode, Visual Studio, and Make files.
  - Supports [AppImage](https://appimage.org) on Linux! See the [release builds guide](https://github.com/Ravbug/wxWidgetsTemplate/wiki/Creating-Release-Builds#linux) on the wiki for more information. 
- [wxFormBuilder](https://github.com/wxFormBuilder/wxFormBuilder) integration – build your interface quickly in their fantastic visual editor!
- Windows High DPI Awareness and helper functions to easily scale your UI to high resolution displays
- Application icons – simply replace the relevant icon file
- Portable codebase  – the library is contained inside, so no need to install the library to every computer. If you do not want this, you can easily remove the library from the project. [More Info](https://github.com/Ravbug/wxWidgetsTemplate/wiki/Referencing-wxWidgets-Externally-(Non-portable))

## Updating the wxWidgets version
Updating the wxWidgets version this project uses is as simple as overwriting the `wxWidgets` folder with the one for the new version. 
See the [Updating wxWidgets](https://github.com/Ravbug/wxWidgetsTemplate/wiki/Updating-or-Resetting-wxWidgets) guide on the Wiki for more information.
